## Earn your first bitcoin - Install Aqua Wallet

After some of the lessons and after completing the course you will receive 2,100 sats (=satoshi, the smallest unit of one bitcoin) from us. For this you need to setup a Bitcoin wallet. 

I recommend the Aqua wallet as a start. It's an easy to use wallet that enables you to self-custody bitcoin and also use Lightning payments via the Liquid sidechain. I will explain these terms later in the course. For now it's important that you install the wallet on your mobile so that you can earn your first bitcoin.

- Download Aqua wallet
	- Android:
	- iPhone:
- Install and then watch above video. Wallet set up info from 11:39 min.
- After completing a lesson you will receive an email from support@cracktheorange.com where we send you a QR code. 
- Open the Aqua wallet and press "receive" Lightning
- Scan the QR code
- The satoshis are being transferred to your wallet.
