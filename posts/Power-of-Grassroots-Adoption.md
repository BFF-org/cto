## Transcript

Many people, when they ask me how will Bitcoin help my country or my nation or my state, then sometimes they wait for the government to do something, to say, Bitcoin, you can use it now. I can tell you one thing, please don't wait for your government or your central bank to allow you to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a grassroots movement and we as individuals are able to use it because it's not illegal. It's not illegal to use Bitcoin. And the earlier you start learning about it and you start using it for remittances, for payments, or even if you are able to save it in small amounts, the more you spread that into your community, your whole country and nation will be uplifted. So also the mining, if companies or individuals in your country start mining Bitcoin, then maybe even like in El Salvador, but it's not very transparent how it's working there, so it should be more transparent and it's not legal tender anymore too. But countries can also try to remove their debt, their debts from the international organizations and other countries by mining their own Bitcoin, storing it, saving it for the future, which increases the value as we have seen over the last 15 years. So this is a possibility to increase the life quality in countries. It's a little bit like if a country suddenly finds oil or gold or other natural resources as commodities that they could sell. It's a little bit like that with Bitcoin. So there are a couple of, a lot of advantages to the use of Bitcoin, but I want to emphasize it starts on the individual level. On bottom up, it's a grassroots movement. And I feel there are many reasons why individuals and communities should and can start using Bitcoin.
