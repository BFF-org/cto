## Transcript

And Bitcoin gives us opportunities. Just look at the purchasing power of bitcoin in 12. 2011 you needed 162 bitcoin to buy a state-of-the-art iPhone, now last year you needed 0.031 bitcoin. You have no inflation in bitcoin, there is no national inflation, no one can in a centralized manner change the 21 million of bitcoin that will ever exist. It's a digital tool. You can easily send it in and out of your country globally. It's resistant, because it's digital. And it can't rot and it's easy to store in that sense compared to stashes of cash. It gives you ownership which is unique. It also includes anyone who wants to use it because it's also permissionless, you don't need a ID for it and it gives you much more privacy than the current financial system.
