## Transcript

You did. Can I just see the ring? Yeah, I'm just waiting. Hey, paid with the ring. Can you just use it once or can you use it everywhere? You can use it as long as you've got something on it, the wallet and then you can connect it and load the ring. How did you get the ring? Where I got it? You can buy it.
