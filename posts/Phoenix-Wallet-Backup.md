## Excerpt

I explain how the iCloud backup in the Phoenix wallet works and discuss the differences to the 12-word seed phrase backup. Watch now to ensure the security of your Bitcoin Lightning funds!

## Transcript

The iCloud backup in the Phoenix wallet stores the history of your payments (and your recovery seed), so it's not really necessary if you feel that storing the payment history on the device itself is enough for you. The difference is, if you use the iCloud backup and you then are changing your device because your old phone died down or whatever and you want to reinstall the Phoenix wallet on a new phone, you will only need the 12-word backup, nothing else. But if you want to see all the historic payments you did, then you will need the iCloud backup. It basically synchronizes the history of all your payments and you will see it again on the new phone.

That's why you might want to do or not to do the iCloud backup, but it's not necessary for the functioning of the Phoenix wallet or even for the security of your funds. The most important thing is the 12-word seed backup that you have to write down on a sheet of paper or maybe on a steel plate and keep it very, very secure, because it will always give you access to your bitcoin or Lightning satoshis in that case.
