## Transcript

And as I said, I've been doing this kind of education for almost seven years now, the last four years very intensively in African countries because I want to share as much knowledge to as many people as possible and I can't do all of that alone. And I found that being there is great to build trust with all the scams we have around and things like that. But there are more and more initiatives in African countries which I applaud. I'm so happy to see you all coming up and I want to support with Bitcoin for Fairness aspiring Bitcoin Educators and Community Builders. So maybe it's you the next time here on stage. We've got one guy from Zambia, Humphrey, he's from our Bitcoin for Fairness community there. He's now going to be the teacher in Bitcoin Victoria Falls, a new Bitcoin circular economy project in Zambia and I'm so happy that he's here. Where is he? Yeah hereâ€™s Humphrey and he will be a speaker today or tomorrow. And if you know anyone who also wants to do that you can apply for a train-the-trainer scholarship on my, on our online learning platform and you only have to apply at anita.link/apply, fill out a short form, tell us your story, tell us your plans, what your goal is with that education and I also have something for you. If you don't want to be an educator, if you just want to use Bitcoin and learn more about it, then you can subscribe to my free newsletter. Once a week, I'm sending out new tutorials, videos, information about Bitcoin. It's anita.link/weekly, you can also buy my book online or maybe on Amazon and I would be very happy to see you in one of my online courses or memberships at Crack the Orange. So, thank you very much.
