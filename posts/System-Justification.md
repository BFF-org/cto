## Excerpt

I explore if system justification is slowing down Bitcoin adoption in Zimbabwe, looking at inflation, government control, fear, and cultural differences compared to Nigeria. Watch now to uncover the ongoing struggle for change amidst oppression.

## Transcript

### The Predictable Cycle

It's a sad story. I don't know why because the people in Zimbabwe, they know what's happening. Everyone knows it. I was talking with a guy in a shop, and he explained to me exactly what's going to happen after Christmas, after the holiday season. He said exactly, you know, you will see in January the inflation, like the exchange rate will go up again because the holidays are over and they start to inflate the country with Zimbabwean dollar again. And exactly that was happening.

### Political Repression and Fear

And the sad thing is that there is almost no opposition. And of course, people are scared because there are abductions, opposition politicians are beaten to death, happens every year. And so people are scared, and so there's no revolution or something happening because, I mean, the government has the military on its side and yeah, it's a sad situation.

### Limited Adoption Despite Clear Solutions

And sometimes, to be honest, I'm a little bit frustrated because I also think, I mean, it's the best solution for the people there, but it's not that so many people are using it like in Nigeria, for instance. So much more people are using it there. Yeah. Why is there a difference, you think?

### Cultural and Historical Factors

Why is there a difference? I think a little bit it's the history and the, not psychology, the, you know how people are. The Shona people for instance are very peaceful people always have been in comparison to South African tribes or people who are much more violent. Interestingly, I don't know why that is but this is an observation that a lot of people have made and also told me and so I think that's one of the reasons.

### System Justification Theory

And another thing I believe is system justification. I think if you're in a very bad situation and you see no way out then you are better off living with the same situation you already know then saying to yourself oh I'm in a desperate situation I need something new. Change is not possible exactly.
