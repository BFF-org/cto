## Excerpt

I explain what it really means when we say Bitcoin is censorship resistant. I also talk about why censorship resistance matters for activists, human rights organizations, and anyone facing authoritarian control. Watch now to learn how self-custody, private keys, and mining all play a role in protecting your freedom to use Bitcoin without interference.

## Transcript

What does it mean when we say Bitcoin is resistant to censorship? We mean by that that Bitcoin is immutable. If you hold Bitcoin in self-custody, that means you own the private keys to your funds on the blockchain, then no one can take your Bitcoin away. No one can hinder you from accessing it. You with the seed phrase, the 12 words you get from your wallet, are the only person that can access and send the funds away. And that's what we mean with censorship resistant. It also means that Bitcoin is a tool for people who fight against authoritarians who are working in the human rights space, because these people are very often, and their organization are very often censored by the governments that they are fighting against. That means they can use Bitcoin. They don't have to use a bank account for that, because they are always being shut down. And also the governments then put the money away from them and steal it basically. And with Bitcoin, that can't happen. And that means when we're saying it's censorship resistant. And mining is the aspect that makes Bitcoin immutable and censorship resistant, because the miners will always mine all the transactions that are being done, because they also don't really know where they are coming from. But that's a point of danger, actually, because there are a lot of miners in the US that are industrial miners that are regulated by their governments. That means if a government says to these regulated miners, you have to censor this one transaction to this Bitcoin address. They will need to do that. Otherwise, the people behind the businesses will be arrested or will be punished in a way. And that's also why it's so important that we have home mining, so that people have small miners at home, like a Bitaxe, for instance, or an old ASICs, and also mine, but all transactions. And so that because then no one can tell you to not mine this transaction. And this is so important because without this censorship resistance, we don't need Bitcoin. We can use other ways to pay each other. If we don't have censorship resistant, no decentralization, and only use Bitcoin to hodl as a business, then it's basically like the traditional financial system. And then I wonder what are we actually doing here? I don't need that kind of Bitcoin. I want Bitcoin that's decentralized, that's for the people that can be owned by the people, and is censorship resistant.
