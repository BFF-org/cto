## Transcript

Bitcoin is a Lifeline. As my friend and teacher Andreas Antonopoulos said, it's a R.I.P.C.O.R.D. because it's revolutionary, immutable, public, collaborative, open, resistant to censorship, and decentralized. Where I believe that open is a very, very important property because it gives us all a seat. Anyone can join use Bitcoin and also be a part of the development community because it's open-source, it's resistant to censorship, that's especially important in enforcing the human right to freedom of speech and freedom of association and other human rights, like the right to own property for women are especially interesting. So, you only get those perks when you own your bitcoin. That means if you self-custody them. People might say that's complicated. Well, as a matter of fact, it's only 12 English words in the correct order that you need to take care of.
