## Transcript

So what am I doing? I copied the Lightning invoice from choker to my clipboard on telegram or to my clipboard on the phone and now I open up Phoenix again. so here I have Phoenix. Now I say 'send 'and then it asks me asks me to paste the data from the clipboard and I say 'yes'. And now I also know that you're a Blink wallet user and you can see I'm going to send you.. Ah! You required, you asked me to send that amount. Yes, of course, that's an amount I'm willing to send and now I'm saying 'pay' and it's being sent. You should see it now in your wallet.

Okay, now Rockstar has sent an invoice. Let me copy that to telegram so that I can have it on my phone. Got it on my phone, I copy it into my clipboard, I change over to Phoenix, I say 'send' and again it asks me to paste data from the clipboard and immediately I see that Rockstar is using Wallet of Satoshi and he sent an amountless invoice. This is something that you can do if you trust your peer because, no you don't need to trust because I can send you a lot, so now I have to choose how much I want to send. How much did I send before? 2,351 I think it was. Yes so I send you the same amount and you can see also how much the fee will be. It will be 13 satoshis which is one US dollar cent. Okay now I say 'pay' and it's sent. Rockstar you should have received.

Okay, so I mean, I think Rockstar is in Tanzania, right? Others might be in Uganda and so I'm sitting in Austin, Texas. You see how fast that went. And the bitcoin, the satoshi you have in that wallet now, they are really yours - except for the Wallet of Satoshi. But if you use Blink or Phoenix or, what else, the Breez app, for instance, Breez is also a self- custody Lightning Wallet. Blink is still custodial, I think they're working on going non-custodial but is still. Those are still not your keys, of course.You're completely right. I forgot Blink is a shared-custody, right? It's the former Bitcoin Beach Wallet. How was it called? I think it's a community custody. So yes you're right, it's custodial.
