## Excerpt

I discuss the critical role that community and meetups play in driving Bitcoin adoption and education, especially in Africa. Watch now to learn why grassroots efforts and local initiatives like Bitcoin for Fairness Zambia matter.

## Transcript

It's very important to be on the ground so to show up, to explain things, especially to get into the problems that are really there on the ground because we can't imagine the problems that people have in these countries. It's so different from our lives, and people have to hustle every day. From that perspective, when they come to a talk or a workshop, it's very important to build trust. From there on, I believe you need sustainable education in the sense that you have a person or a group of people where you can go to. I mean, it's the same in Europe with the meetups, you know. Meetups are great because you always have the possibility to meet someone who knows more about Bitcoin than you, and you can ask them. You can maybe exchange Bitcoin to fiat currencies and back. That's why I think it's so important to have these local initiatives, the local Bitcoin meetup groups, who can share knowledge with each other, have their own WhatsApp groups or Telegram groups to stay in touch about the newest developments in their own region. That is what we have been doing with Bitcoin for Fairness in Zambia and in Zimbabwe and supporting other initiatives in other African countries. Crack the Orange is basically leveling it up, so it's a level two education, so that the communities on the ground can grow by themselves. The program is 12 months, so in that 12 months, they can always check in and ask new questions. And as we all know, Bitcoin and especially Lightning is a very fast-developing technology, so things change very often. I think it's important that people have contacts to check back on what's the best wallet at the moment and things like that.
