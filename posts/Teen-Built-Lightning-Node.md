## Transcript

**Q: Hello, nice to meet you. Slooh told me that you were the one who set up the Lightning node. Is that true?**

A: Yes, that is true.

**Q: Can you show me the node?**

A: In there.
*(points to the device)*

**Q: This one? And that is now a Lightning node?**

A: It is a full node.

**Q: What is running on there?**

A: A [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/).

**Q: How did you learn to set that up?**

A: We were doing online meetups with Open Arms, who was helping us learn.

**Q: That is super great. How long did it take you to learn all of that?**

A: Approximately five to six months.

**Q: You must really be interested in it, hey?**

A: Very much. So much.

**Q: Do you think this is going to be your job in the future?**

A: Maybe. I think so, yeah.

**Q: Do you like it?**

A: Yes, I like it so much. I love computer science and everything about computers.

**Q: What are your goals? I assume you are using Bitcoin yourself, but are you also still in school?**

A: Yeah.

**Q: How old are you?**

A: I am 16, turning 17.

**Q: And when did you start learning about Bitcoin?**

A: In October 2021.

**Q: Oh wow, so you have been into Bitcoin for almost four years now?**

A: Yes.

**Q: And you have learned a lot in that time?**

A: Yes. I have also been having online classes with Jason. He is from the US, in Ohio.

**Q: What kind of classes?**

A: We were reading the [Bitcoin White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper). Every Tuesday, we have sessions—kind of like a book club.

**Q: So I assume, since you set up the node yourself, you really like this kind of work. What were you doing before you got into Bitcoin?**

A: Before Bitcoin, I was just sitting in the house, playing with other children when I was around 10 or 11. Then I joined [The Surfer Kids](https://www.thesurferkids.com/) in May 2019. I think I was in grade five.

**Q: And you did not know about Bitcoin back then?**

A: No, I was just going to school, coming back home, doing homework—that was it.

**Q: When did that change? When did you realize you liked this?**

A: My friend introduced me to The Surfer Kids, and I was interested. I joined to learn how to surf. But surfing was hard for me. I was struggling to adapt. That is when I first met Christo, and he introduced me to Bitcoin.

**Q: So that was your first contact with Bitcoin?**

A: Yes. That is where I learned about it.

**Q: I remember being there once, three years ago, when Christo was teaching. You were learning with sats and passing Lightning torches around, right?**

A: Yes. That was my first time learning about Bitcoin.

**Q: What did you like about it?**

A: The science behind it. Like how did [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) create it? It was so interesting. I wanted to know what Bitcoin is and how it works—the Bitcoin network around the world.

**Q: So you were not just interested in using it—you wanted to understand it?**

A: Yes.

**Q: That is super great, I love it. So what are your plans for the next years?**

A: I want to go to a university of technology. I want to study and become a computer scientist, an IT specialist. Then I will start investing in Bitcoin, saving Bitcoin. Then I want to buy a house and a car.

**Q: Using Bitcoin?**

A: Yes. I am just going to take it step by step.

**Q: And I think with your experience already at that young age, you are going to be a great Bitcoin or Lightning developer.**

A: Yes, very much.

**Q: Super! Thank you.**

A: Thank you so much.
