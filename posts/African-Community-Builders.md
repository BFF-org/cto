## Transcript

She's willing to go to places where other people can't go or don't have the time to go or are not willing to go, far out of the way places, you know. She made a lot of effort to come and visit our project which is far out of the way so not everybody has the ability to do that, but it's important work that needs to be done if we want to see Bitcoin become mainstream. 
 
I think it's very important for us to remember that Bitcoin has no marketing department neither does it have a centralized marketing budget for people to be able to allocate resources to where we think is useful. It's really a community for and by the people. So for all those Bitcoiners out there who have either benefited or see her work as very beneficial to the space, an important thing to do is support her work. 
 
Well it's a common phenomena in Bitcoin that it's decentralized so unlike you know companies or Altcoins there is no central party to fund anything and so you know if we want anything to happen in Bitcoin, you know people will sort of sit around and say well there should be more of this or some education should happen, like basically the only way things happen is by volunteering and doing which Anita is doing or helping sponsor people you know with patreon and things like that to do work that you think is valuable for society and for Bitcoin.
 
Traveling out to Africa and trying to spread the knowledge of Bitcoin education about Bitcoin it's not the glory work, it's the hard work, but it's really important work you know. These are the people who need Bitcoin as much as anyone else and so the fact that Anita is doing it, I think she's doing God's work. I say that as an atheist but she's doing God's work and so I would like to support more and everyone else should support more. If you're listening, support Anita. 
 
In fact, we need more Anitas in the world and I think we need to support her because it means that the world is going to be better. The education is going to be right and people are going to grow as humans and in different parts of the world.
 
I think it's important because Bitcoin is especially useful in so-called third world countries, in countries that have a lot of struggle about inclusion in the financial and commercial world especially online, trouble with money, in general. Places like Africa are the places where these problems are really really serious and in order to help  this situation and to stay independent, well doing what Anita is, basically using crowdfunding instead of relying on a single sponsor, that can manipulate sometimes the message in order to push for some solution or the other. 
 
If you can support another Bitcoiner, you help Bitcoin succeed. So in my opinion, all Bitcoiners are incentivized to help one another in the long run because if Bitcoiners succeed, Bitcoin succeeds. So we all have an incentive to help one another. 
 
There is this misconception in the first world that Bitcoin is going to happen thanks to Wall Street and thanks to investors. Investors are powerless, greedy, useless people. We win. Bitcoin wins on boarding Africa, Central America, South America, the Emerging Markets, that's how we win. Anita is building a bridge for these people and on boarding them into Bitcoin. 
 
She doesn't take sponsorships so she relies on community support, she relies on working with like-minded people and basically she's like a, she's fully in the open source spirit, right. So we need to find ways that we can help her out, that we can work with her, and that we can support her, and if you can, I think you should. 
 
So we often beat around the bush this idea that Bitcoin is for everyone but most of the people that talk about that are in a position of privilege, like extreme privilege and Anita's work focuses on that larger pie where Bitcoin could be way more meaningful Bitcoin, could have a greater impact, and yeah she gives a voice to those people and gives a platform to those people. All of the work done by these educators with platforms, they influence and motivate others to carry out this what I consider really meaningful work. So yeah that's why you should do it. 
 
We have to support education and Bitcoin educators not influencers and if we do not support the educators to be able to get out there and orange-pill as many people as we can and help build the lives for the future of the people that she's trying to reach then what are we here for? Really. 
 
It's with anything in free software, if it doesn't get funded, it will dwindle away and not be done anymore so it's quite important that Bitcoiners who really want to make sure that Bitcoin succeeds in the long run pitch in and and toss in some sats to ensure that the entrepreneurs and enthusiasts who really keep this project alive and thriving that they have the the comfort and the security to keep doing the amazing work that they're doing.
