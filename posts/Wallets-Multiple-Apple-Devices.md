## Transcript

The question is: In iOS, can wallets be installed on both an iPad and an iPhone? Which would be more secure? Yes so apps for Apple like Bitcoin wallets, for instance, can be installed on the iPhone or an iPad so if you're using the security options in both of those operating systems, the security should be quite the same. So I don't think that there is a difference between iPad or iOS. It's definitely more secure than Android, I think, but in between those two devices is not much of a difference. So both devices are secured via an Apple ID and you can also track them if you lost it or if someone has stolen it via the find app, I think Find My is the name of the app. so if you're using all the security options I am recommending in my chapters in the online course, I have chapters about the topic of security and safety of your devices and your wallets, if you use all of that, like strong passwords, a PIN to lock your phone and your wallet, and you always update to the most recent IOS operating system when Apple is asking you to, it should be very secure on both devices.
