## Excerpt

I encourage you to get involved with Bitcoin and to help create solutions tailored to each country's unique needs and, thus, fostering inclusion. I share insights how South Africa, for example, is pioneering circular economies and making remittances easier, demonstrating the power of local involvement and innovation. Learn how by getting involved, we can all contribute to Bitcoin's future and ensure it meets the diverse needs of our communities.

## Transcript

So, I'm here to appeal to you, also get yourself involved like, for instance, I mean South Africa is a pioneering country in Bitcoin. You got circular economies, you, everyone knows [Bitcoin Ekasi](https://www.bitcoinekasi.com), [Bitcoin Witsand](https://twitter.com/BitcoinWitsand), then you can remit easily bitcoin also to Zimbabwe by just buying a voucher sending the code to someone in Zimbabwe and this person can redeem. Involvement fosters inclusion! Please involve yourself.

There's [THNDR Games](https://thndr.games), a great app to stack your first sats by gaming, but then you have to use Google, you have to use Twitter to be able to use it. I recently had a young guy in a workshop in Zimbabwe he couldn't use it because he doesn't have a Google account or a Twitter account.

Build your own systems like KG has done with [Machankura](https://8333.mobi). Involve yourself! You guys here, you are fostering innovation.

For instance, yesterday I was at PicknPay, I said the word, and paid my groceries with Lightning. It's easy, it's secure and fast. So, thanks to [Carel](https://x.com/carelvwyk) for that. Or you can spend your bitcoin on electricity here as well. Carel told me yesterday the real innovation is that if a payment fails for any reason, the Lightning payment comes back to you which is something that's not possible on Bitcoin at the moment.

We have [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com), [Craig Raw](https://twitter.com/craigraw), here as well, one of the best desktop Bitcoin on-chain wallets in the world.
