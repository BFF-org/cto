I explain how you can turn bitcoin into cash or use it directly in everyday life across several African countries. From peer-to-peer trades to apps like Tando and spending BTC at PicknPay in South Africa - it’s more possible than you think. Watch now to see how Bitcoin is being used on the ground!

## Transcript

Yes, of course, bitcoin can be converted to cash. I don't know which country you are from, but I know in a lot of African countries, also in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Nigeria, Kenya, you will find people on the ground, money traders, that will accept your bitcoin and give you cash for it. In Kenya, for instance, there is an app called Tando. You can use it to use Lightning, pay in bitcoin, and the recipient receives M-Pesa directly into their mobile money. Even from other countries, like if you're from Zimbabwe, you can download Tando and send bitcoin into an M-Pesa account in Kenya. In South Africa, you can spend bitcoin at every PicknPay, which is a supermarket chain, actually the second largest in South Africa, meaning you have hundreds of possibilities to buy groceries, clothing with Bitcoin at PicknPay. And there are more and more merchants starting to accept bitcoin.
