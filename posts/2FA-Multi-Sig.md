### Green Wallet: A Multi-Sig Tutorial

You have recently released a tutorial on how to install the Blockstream Wallet. The Blockstream Wallet offers multi-sig options. What makes it different from other wallets that offer multi-sig, too?

### Unique Multi-Sig Feature with 2FA

Yes, that's a great question. The Blockstream Wallet multi-sig option is basically that you can add a **2FA (two-factor authentication)** method to your wallet. This means that **you hold one key**—the seed to your wallet—and additionally, **Blockstream**, the makers of the wallet, hold a key on their servers. You control access to that second key through your 2FA method.

Let’s say you take the Blockstream Wallet and add an email and/or an authenticator app. You now have a **two-out-of-two setup**. This is especially useful if you're a company and not allowed to sign a transaction alone, or if you can’t afford a hardware wallet—or simply don’t have one yet.

### Extra Security Without Hardware

The second-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security. For instance, if someone gets your phone or device, they can try to send a transaction, but **they’ll also need access to the second factor**. If you have the Blockstream Wallet on your desktop and the 2FA app on your smartphone, then no one can send your bitcoin from the desktop without the smartphone's authentication.

### Ideal for Teams or Organizations

This setup is also great for companies. Let’s say you need **two people to authorize an expense**: one person can initiate the transaction, and the second person can provide the 2FA code to approve it.

### Comparing with Other Multi-Sig Wallets

The difference from other wallets—such as Sparrow—is in complexity. With Sparrow, if you set up a multi-sig wallet, you might need **three hardware wallets** (e.g., BitBox02, Trezor, Coldcard) for a **two-out-of-three setup**. That means connecting all devices and managing a more complex setup, which can be intimidating for beginners.

The Blockstream Wallet's two-out-of-two setup with 2FA (email or authenticator app) is **much more beginner-friendly** and suitable for users who cannot invest in multiple hardware wallets.

### Liquid, Lightning, and the Future

Another reason I used Blockstream Wallet in the tutorial is because it also supports **Liquid wallets**, and Blockstream is working on **self-custody Lightning accounts**. In the future, you’ll be able to manage **Liquid and Lightning assets with the same seed phrase**—just one seed for all.

Once Blockstream releases the new Lightning functionality, I plan to make a new tutorial. Also, with rising on-chain fees, it's important to explore **cheaper options like Lightning and Liquid** for transactions.
