## Transcript

Why did you choose WhatsApp as a platform for Machankura? Okay, so we pay USSD, we have a USSD gateway provider. You see, that's a point of failure for us as a company. So we feel that we want to give our users a variety of options such that when one option fails, they have accessibility throughout the platform. So we have the USSD option, we have the WhatsApp option, we have the web option, and we also have an app option. That way, if one site is down, our users can still access their funds through other sites. Right now, I'm going to demonstrate the WhatsApp option. It's available globally as long as your country is on the list. Is on the list, yeah, because for Austria it doesn't work. I just wanted to try. But you said actually almost every or every African country, it should be possible. Yeah, every African country, it should be possible. So I'm starting up as well. So I'm starting a new session where I'm going to show you our menu. So the menu that is in the USSD version is still as well on the - So it looks the same as on the USSD version? Exactly. Yeah. So, same options: send bitcoin, receive bitcoin, phone number, Lightning address, username, LN invoice, on-chain. I think what the important point is for that is like in Zimbabwe, for instance, millions of people have WhatsApp, and they only have WhatsApp bundles because the internet is so expensive. Yes. Is this the same in a lot of African countries? Absolutely, it's the same. In fact, WhatsApp is actually free in a majority - okay, I don't know - for Kenya, we usually have a WhatsApp free bundle. So I'm guessing it's the same. So everyone actually in this country who has a smartphone - Yes. - and internet can use WhatsApp for free? Yes. And that's why so many people use it, right? Absolutely. And so they only have to go to your website, 8333.mobi - Yes. -and they scroll down to the WhatsApp option? Yes. And then you click there, and then you immediately can start? Yes, absolutely. But that's fantastic. Yeah. Because a lot of people don't have internet on their phones, so they can't download a regular wallet. Yes. Fantastic. Thank you very much. Most welcome.
